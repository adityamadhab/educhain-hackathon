# Blockchain-Based School Management

## Vision

The Blockchain-Based School Management aims to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure system for managing school operations. It allows for seamless registration and management of students and teachers, providing a tamper-proof record of their data. This contract can be expanded to support various administrative functions, fostering trust and efficiency in educational institutions.
